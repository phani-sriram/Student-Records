# Student-Records
A system to manage student records written in C
This project was done as part of our C-project in our First Year at International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore
It gives us the option to view and change the personal info and the grades in various subjects of a particular student
There is no Graphical User Interface and it runs only on the terminal.
To run the program go to the directory in which the files are present and enter the command ./run on the command line
The usernames and passwords are as follows:
1. The student Usernames are of the form "MT2020XXX" where XXX start from 001 to 020
   The passwords for the student are exactly the same as the username
2. The faculty usernames depends on the subject that they teach for example the username of the machine learning faculty is Mlearning. Compiler Design is Cdesign
   The password is the same
3. The password for coordinator is admin
Keep in mind that only the coordinator can edit the grades the others can just view the grades.
